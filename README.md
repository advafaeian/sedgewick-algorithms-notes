# Sedgewick’s *Algorithms* Notes

<img src="./cover.png" alt="The book cover" width="150"/>

This repository contains Markdown (`.md`) notes based on the classic book *“Algorithms, 4th Edition”* by Robert Sedgewick and Kevin Wayne.

The book is a great candidate for condensation, as it offers clear implementations and excellent illustrations serving as an abstract way of conveying information. With just the right amount of explanatory text added, these notes make the material more concise and accessible, ideal for refreshing key concepts and preparing for interviews.

I’ve also included personal notes where I found they help clarify certain ideas or provide additional intuition.

To maintain orthogonality and conciseness, I included content related to the Java language selectively. For the complete material, see Chapters 1.1, 1.2, and 1.3 of the book.
